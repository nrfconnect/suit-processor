/** The envelope contains the manifest and its signature plus a few other things.
 *
 *  The envelope contains:
 *  - The SUIT manifest.
 *  - The signature(s) of the manifest. One or more signatures or MACs.
 *  - "severable" manifest members. These are parts of the manifest that can be
 *    discarded when not needed any more, like installation instructions after
 *    an update, or text descriptions that will not be needed. These members
 *    are referenced by digest in the manifest, so they are covered by the
 *    signature.
 *  - Pre-fetched or integrated payloads. When the manifest processor is
 *    fetching payloads, it can check the envelope to see if it's there.
 *    The payload might have been placed there by the manifest creator, or a
 *    previous handler has fetched the payload and placed it there.
 *  - Delegation chains if the manifest is signed by someone else than the owner
 *    of the manifest processor's root of trust key. The delegation chain is a
 *    chain of signatures (like a certificate) leading back to the root of trust
 *    key.
